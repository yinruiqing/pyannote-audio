    """(X_batch, y_batch) batch generator

    Yields batches made of subsequences obtained using a sliding
    window over the audio files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extractor : YaafeFeatureExtractor
    duration: float, optional
        yield segments of length `duration`
        Defaults to 3.2s.
    step: float, optional
        step of sliding window (in seconds).
        Defaults to 0.8s.
    balance: float, optional
        Artificially increase the number of positive labels by
        labeling as positive every frame in the direct neighborhood
        (less than balance seconds apart) of each change point.
        Defaults to 0.01s (10 ms).
    batch_size: int, optional
        Size of batch
        Defaults to 32

    Returns
    -------
    X_batch : (batch_size, n_samples, n_features) numpy array
        Batch of feature sequences
    y_batch : (batch_size, n_samples) numpy array
        Batch of corresponding label sequences
